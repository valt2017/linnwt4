LinNWT4
=======

This repository contains the last release of LinNWT4 V4.11.10 modified to build with Qt5. The original source code obtained from: http://web.archive.org/web/20180826144745fw_/http://www.dl4jal.eu/linnwt4_V4_11_10.tar.gz

The goal was to get it building and running to test the spectrum analyzer I own. Fixing bugs or cleaning up the code was never the goal. There are no plans to make any releases.

Please don't bother the author of original software about anything. The fact that it disappeared from his website says a lot.

Quick start
-----------

```
$ qmake-qt5 or qmake
$ make
$ ./linnwt app_en.qm
```
